[Packet Batch](https://github.com/Packet-Batch) is a collection of high-performance tools used for generating network packets. These tools are commonly used for penetration testing, benchmarking, and network monitoring.

This repository serves as the Rust implementation of Packet Batch. While Packet Batch was originally written in C ([`pktbatch-c`](https://github.com/Packet-Batch/pktbatch-c)), this Rust version aims to provide a safer and more modern codebase while maintaining high performance.

That said, this will now be the main repository for Packet Batch. While `pktbatch-c` will still be maintained, all new features and improvements will be developed in this Rust implementation. The C version will only receive critical bug fixes.

## 🚀 Features
* Fast packet generation using technologies such as [AF_XDP sockets](https://docs.kernel.org/networking/af_xdp.html).
    * ⚠️ AF_XDP support is currently the only available option, but support for other technologies (e.g., DPDK, AF_PACKET, etc.) will likely be added in the future!
* Highly configurable packet generation with support for various protocols and custom payloads.
    * Hostname and DNS lookup support.
    * Supports generating random source and destination IP addresses, ports, and other header fields like the IP TTL and ID fields.
* A watcher mode that displays real-time statistics and a graph of the current TX stats of the interface.
    * This retrieves counters from the NIC itself written in the `/proc/net/dev` file. Therefore, displaying stats in the watcher mode should have minimal impact on the overall performance of packet generation!
* Detailed logging of packet generation activity, including support for different log levels and log file management.
* Support for executing multiple batches of packets with different configurations.
* Command-line interface that includes arguments for overriding the first batch's configuration without modifying the configuration file on disk.

## 🚨 Experimental
The Rust implementation of Packet Batch is currently in the early stages of development and is considered **experimental**! That said, I'm still fairly new to Rust and there may be some bugs and performance issues that need to be ironed out.

However, from the testing I've concluded so far, everything should work and performance is actually better than the C version!!

This is something I plan on looking into. This is likely due to how the AF_XDP sockets are setup and used in the Rust version, but I haven't had the time to verify this yet.

## 🛠️ Building
### XDP Tools (LibXDP, LibBPF, etc.)
You will need to install [`xdp-tools`](https://github.com/xdp-project/xdp-tools) and its dependencies to build the AF_XDP version of the project (only version available at this time). I recommend following the instructions from [here](https://github.com/xdp-project/xdp-tutorial/blob/main/setup_dependencies.org).

Here are commands I run on Debian-based systems to set up the dependencies:

```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo apt update

sudo apt install -y clang llvm libelf-dev libpcap-dev build-essential libc6-dev-i386 m4 git

# Clone and build xdp-tools
git clone --recursive https://github.com/xdp-project/xdp-tools

cd xdp-tools

# Build and install xdp-tools
make

# Install xdp-tools to the system.
sudo make install

# While it shouldn't be technically needed, I always build and install LibBPF which is a sub-module inside of `xdp-tools`.
# Change to the libbpf directory.
cd lib/libbpf/src

# Build and install libbpf
make

sudo make install
```

### The Project
After installing the dependencies above, it's time to build the main project. Firstly, let's quickly clone the repository.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Packet-Batch/pktbatch-rs

# Change to the project directory
cd pktbatch-rs
```

You **must** have Rust installed on your system. You can install Rust using [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/). Once you have Rust installed, you can build the project using Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system.

```bash
# Install Rust using rustup (if you haven't already)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Build the project in release mode
cargo build --release
```

This will compile the project and produce an executable in the `target/release` directory.

If you'd like to use the `pktbatch` executable system-wide instead of using `cargo run`, you can use the [`install_to_path.sh`](./install_to_path.sh) script to copy the executable to the `/usr/bin/` directory.

```bash
# Install pktbatch to /usr/bin/ (included in $PATH; requires sudo).
./install_to_path.sh

# Now you can use 'pktbatch' from anywhere in the terminal.
sudo pktbatch --help

sudo pktbatch -c ./local.json -i eth0
```

## ⚙️ Usage
After building the project, you can run the executable to generate network packets. The exact usage will depend on the command-line arguments you provide along with the main program's configuration file.

## 📝 Configuration
The configuration file is a JSON file that defines logging options and the batches of packets to be generated. Each batch can have its own configuration, and the tool will execute each batch sequentially.

The default path is `./config.json`, but you can specify a different path using the `-c` or `--cfg` command-line argument.

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `logger` | Logger object | The logging object contain settings related to program and file logging. |
| `tech` | Tech object | The technology object contains settings related to the packet generation technology (e.g., AF_XDP, DPDK, etc.). |
| `batch` | Batch object | The batch object that contains a list of batches and overrides. |

### Logger Object
The logger object contains settings related to `stdout`/`stderr` and on-disk logging.

The log level can be set to one of the following values (case-insensitive):
* `trace`
* `debug`
* `info`
* `warn`
* `error`
* `fatal`

### Tech Object
